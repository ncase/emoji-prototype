In emoji.\n\nMy hope is that this can help people make more stuff like Parable of the Polygons, interactives that help people understand the complex systems of the world we live in. Also, emoji.\n\nIn this simulation, you can edit EVERYTHING. Draw on the grid, modify the rules, even change these very words you're reading! And at the end, you can save and share your creation. That's the cool thing: there is *no* difference between playing & making, between reading & writing.\n\nThat's the Forest Fire model to your left. Pretty, isn't it? Scroll down, and you'll find the rules for it, exposed for you to play with. Have fun!\n\n(P.S: 10 points to the first person to make Conway's Game of Life with the üí© emoji)"
