// THIS IS JUST A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT
<br>
// us storytellers and teachers, artists and activists, 
<br>
// we got fancy techniques
<br>
// but to really change the world, we need to ALSO teach people about the systems that run the world.
<br>
// make that complexity, simple. (Play-ful pun?) Maybe even friendly.

<p>
And what could be friendlier than a cute emoji?

<p>
MORE EXAMPLES, and flesh out use cases.
NO DIFFERENCE IN READING AND WRITING.
I made all this in the editor, no cheating.
<br>
public health in my city,
<br>
activism (schelling - and adding new mechanics),
<br>
explaining news (peacekeeping/genocide/terrorism model - if more advanced, policy could use ABMs)
// or something else, maybe
<br>
crowdsourcing solutions.

the specific tool here is NOT "the" answer.
some conclusion here please.
maybe talk about more complex models.

Other Stuff:

- Chewing it FOR them & regurgitating it into their mouths

<!--

WHAT TIES THIS "LEARNING TO CHEW" THING
to the theme of
IMPORTANCE OF COMPLEXITY

Probably a lot. Probably nothing.
Just tie it tighter.
Need to learn to chew & challenge so we
can ALL work on these hard problems together

Reductionism works best with machines.
Holistic thinking works best with human intuition

-->

<p>
A big sandbox.
If you're still with me, the BIG thing.
<br><br>
Maybe we're doing it all wrong.
Learned helplessness. People waiting to be given the answers, at most, *looking up* an answer.
CREATING solutions and answers, training their critical thinking muscles.
And make a solution for their own local situation,
let them bring in their own knowledge, expression, curiosity.
Learning to chew vs making more easily swallowable food.
<br><br>
Debunk some stuff about interactivity,
many myths *I've* fallen for.
<br><br>
Interactivity: not "cool", not even "helps people remember more".
<br><br>
Transmission vs Construction. MORE THAN YOU PUT IN.
MORE HUMANE.
<br><br>
Optimistic: We're all connected in this system,
small changes can become large.
Only YOU can prevent forest fires.
<!-- YES! Like our stories and talks,
write from beginning to end,
AND! And make lots and lots of callbacks.
Also, lots of comedy. (or at least whimsy)

And now, a sandbox. (surprise!!! "oh, and now you can save your model and get a public link to")
