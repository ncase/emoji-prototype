<!-- MAIN ESSAY -->
<div class="words">

<p>
Technology's great.
With a tap of a button, you, too, can get all the world's crises,
corruption, and tragedies delivered straight to your eyeballs.
Never has existential dread been so easy! 📲∿∿∿💀🔥📉
</p>

<p>
But seriously.
As someone who loves to learn (and teach!) stuff,
sometimes, learning about the world's complex systems makes me feel...
helpless. Or worse, apathetic.
I'm just a cog in this system, just a tree in this forest,
and if I were to fall, would I make a sound?
How can I understand these systems, let alone change them?
</p>

<p>
I'm still figuring it out,
but I think I've found something that can help.
And to explain it, I'll need some happy little trees. 🌲🌲🌲
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Trees Can Only Be Born
	</div>
	<div id="description">
		
		Every simulation on this page can be changed on the fly.
		For example, <b>try increasing the growth rate from 0.01% to a higher number.</b>
		How would you grow the thickest possible forest?

		<div></div>

		(P.S: <b>You can even change the emoji icons!</b> 🍎😺🐝🌵💙🌸😈💩
		<br>
		Since you're on a Mac, you can hold down Command+Control+Space to select an emoji.)

	</div>
	<iframe class="example" src="model?local=growth&save=no" style="height:350px"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
To get the thickest forest, just turn the growth rate up to 100%.
Well duh, that's kinda obvious.
I'm starting simple, so we can slowly add complexity.
And step by step, you'll discover, for yourself, some pretty counterintuitive stuff,
not just about forests, but about <i>every complex system in the world</i>.
</p>

<p>
Now let's burn these happy little 🌲s.
</p>

<p>
Trees get randomly struck by lightning, setting them on fire. 🌲➡🔥
Also, any tree next to fire also catches on fire. 🔥🌲➡🔥🔥
Simple enough. First a rule to increase growth,
now rules to decrease growth.
Well, just turn up growth to counter the burning, right?
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Trees Can Be Born &amp; Be Burn...ed
	</div>
	<div id="description">

		The growth rate starts at 0.2%.
		<b>What happens when you move it up? Or move it down?</b>
		By the way, you can scroll the sidebar for more options,
		like adding new rules or changing the entire grid.

		<div></div>

		(P.S: Feel free to play around, and do more than the instructions tell you to do!
		You might discover things I haven't even <i>thought</i> of.)

	</div>
	<iframe class="example" src="model?local=forest&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Yup. Beyond a certain point, <i>more growth is worse</i>.
</p>

<p>
This is so counterintuitive, because we're so used to thinking <i>linearly</i>:
more is more, less is less. Yet here, more is less.
Even more shocking, this complex &amp; nonlinear behavior emerges
from simple &amp; linear rules! It comes <i>from the bottom up</i>.
</p>

<p>
This nonlinearity happens because any given tree is a threat to its neighbors,
since they can set each other on fire. One tree's growth is another's downfall,
and vice versa. 🌲📈↔🌲📉
</p>

<p>
Still, that defies all common sense. So just like real life, then.
</p>

<p>
Thing is, you could see this model forest as a parable for our modern world.
As many ecologists and economists have warned us,
<i>more is not always better.</i>
High growth can make a system fragile.
For example:
If a financial system grows too fast, it could make financial crises spread wider...
like wildfire. 🔥🔥🔥
</p>

<p>
And now, bears that kill trees. 🐻 This can't be good.
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires 🐻
	</div>
	<div id="description">
		Any tree next to a bear gets killed. 🐻🌲➡🐻◽️
		<b>Click &amp; drag across the grid to draw walls of bears.</b>
		Divide the grid up into a dozen small sections, then press "play".
		(The sections don't have to be even, but make sure there aren't any huge gaps in the walls.)
		How do the forest and forest fires change?
	</div>
	<iframe class="example" src="model?local=firebreak&auto=no&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
And... these bears that <i>kill</i> trees, in the right formation,
can actually help contain forest fires, and thus, help <i>more</i> trees grow!
</p>

<p>
At this point, you might think I'm full of 💩.
It's not like firefighters actively go out and burn down trees in order to save the forest,
except... that's exactly what they do!
If you've heard the phrase “fight fire with fire”,
that comes the practice of doing controlled burns,
to get rid of flammable material that could spread wildfires.
</p>

<p>
➡🔥🔥🔥🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🚒🔥🚒🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🏠🏢🏠
</p>

<p>
Tying this to non-forest life:
lots of people, on all points on the political spectrum,
think it's government <i>versus</i> markets.
Yet, as you discovered just now,
sometimes a restriction on something can help it grow <i>more</i>,
and what's true for ecologies might also be true for economies.
(but! we'll see a counter-argument later on.)
</p>

<p>
One more iteration!
Our forest wouldn't be an ecosystem with just one plant type.
So, let's create a forest with these two species:
</p>

<p>
🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
invincible to fire, but if four or more of its neighbors are Jerk Weeds,
it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
</p>

<p>
🌱 <b>Jerk Weed:</b>
flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as Strong Trees.
</p>

<p>
Now, before you play with the next simulation, 
think about how your 🐻-intervention would affect these plants.
Don't think linearly, think in systems.
Would suppressing fire lead to
more fire-resistent Strong Trees,
or more fire-loving Jerk Weeds?
</p>

</div>

<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where Some Plants Are Jerks
	</div>
	<div id="description">
		Hit "new".
		Watch how the two plant species interact without your intervention.
		Then, hit "pause", hit "new", draw enough 🐻-walls to make a dozen sections, then hit "play".
		How do the two species interact now?

		<div></div>

		(P.S: Again, feel free to explore!
		Were your results a fluke? What if you change the rules, or add a third plant?
		What if you create a different fire-suppression strategy, or set even <i>more</i> things on fire?)

	</div>
	<iframe class="example" src="model?local=invasive&save=no"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="words">

<p>
Without your intervention, the plants form clusters,
each species getting a 50/50 split. (think: why <i>clusters?</i>)
But with your 🐻-walls, the Jerk Weed dominates.
Your intervention to stop fire
helps <i>the more flammable plant</i> win.
(think: why the heck this is.)
</p>

<p>
This is an actual dilemma forest firefighters face,
and is a pretty nasty political problem that'll only get worse as forests get drier.
Suppressing wildfires saves houses -- and lives --
but it's making forests unhealthier,
and <i>has</i> led to even deadlier mega-fires.
</p>

<p>
I guess you could say their plans... <i>backfired</i>.
</p>

<p>
🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥😱🔥
</p>

<p>
Same goes for policy.
While some regulations and protections might help,
they can have unintended consequences, and make things worse in the long run.
&lt;insert policy you hate here, maybe tariffs or "too big to fail", whatever&gt;
</p>

<p>
Should we allow a disaster now,
to stop an even worse disaster 50 years later?
I can't answer that.
But I <i>can</i> say the answer won't come from
good-or-bad, black-and-white, <i>linear</i> thinking.
We need to think in systems, how things emerge from the bottom up.
</p>

<p>
And to think in systems, we first need to <i>talk</i> in systems.
