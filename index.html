<p>But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck, with the ship's time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!</p>

<p>This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</p>

<p>'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she  could.</p>

<p>'No,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and  perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some  minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its  arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think  you're changed, do you?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; 'I can't remember things as I  used&mdash;and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p>

<p>'Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>'Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it all came  different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p>

<p>'Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>Alice folded her hands, and began:&mdash;</p>

<p>'You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; 'so I should  think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well&mdash;eh, stupid?'</p>

<p>'But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to  notice this last remark.</p>

<p>'Of course they were', said the Dormouse; '&mdash;well in.'</p>

<p>This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for  some time without interrupting it.</p>

<p>'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing  its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of  things&mdash;everything that begins with an M&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why with an M?' said Alice.</p>

<p>'Why not?' said the March Hare.</p>

<p>Alice was silent.</p>

<p>The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into  a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with  a little shriek, and went on: '&mdash;that begins with an M, such as  mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness&mdash;you know you say  things are "much of a muchness"&mdash;did you ever see such a thing as a  drawing of a muchness?'</p>

<p>'Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, 'I don't  think&mdash;'</p>
